# astro_coor
A Python module to calculate all the RA/Dec forms, the angular distance, or the angular displaccement of the coordinates.

**astro_coor.py**

The module contains ra/dec classes, and functions: DistanceMode(), DisplacementMode().  

**RADec_convert.py**

A python script could directly be executed in bash/tcsh.  

Features:  

1. Convert given RA and Dec into different forms.  

2. Calculate the distance and P.A. between two given points.  

3. Calculate the shifted location from a given point with the displacement.  

Please checkout 'python RADec\_convert.py -h'.  

**beam_calc.py**

A python script could directly be executed in bash/tcsh, which can calculate the beam size from given freq/wavelength and diameter.  

Please checkout 'python beam\_calc.py -h'.  

**em_wave.py**

A python script could directly be executed in bash/tcsh, which can calculate the freq from a given wavelength and vice versa.  

Please checkout 'python em\_wave.py -h'.
